This game will have 2 players. 
If you roll a dice and get a value other than 1 you can continue rolling, but if you get 1 inbetween, your score will get to zero and other player will get the chance to roll the dice. You can click on hold when you wanna hold the score and it will add the value to your current score. The first one to have the value 100 by rolling dice will be the winner.
